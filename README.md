# Purpose
In this project, we have worked on a Natural Language Processing classification model to analyze the sentiments of users' comments.

# Description
- The dataset we have used in this project is (Amazon Reviews)[https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Watches_v1_00.tsv.gz]
- For preprocessing the data we have used techniques such as tokenization, the removal of stopwords, lemmatization, stemming, and normalization.
- A neural network for sentiment analysis was created using TensorFlow
- To enhance the performance of the neural network, transfer learning was utilized, leveraging the pre-trained language model BERT. Embedded layers were incorporated   to capture meaningful representations of the text.
